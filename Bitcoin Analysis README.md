## What this project is about

This dashboard contains an analysis of Bitcoin vs SP500 prices in 2021.

The data includes information such as dates, opening and closing values,
maximum and minimum values, and volume. My analysis covers the upside 
of investing in either currency, the spread of both currencies, some 
exploratory data analysis, and a final recommendation for a potential 
investor.
