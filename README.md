## What this project is about

This dashboard contains the story of a fictional coffee company and their bean sales from 2019-2022. 
The data includes information such as bean type (Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, Extensa), different 
package weights (in kg), different roasts, customer data, sales by country, and whether the customer
had a loyalty card at the time of purchase.

### Source

The data is open-source and was gathered from a github repository under user Mo Chen / mochen862.
